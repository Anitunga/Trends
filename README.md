# IT Trends: Stay Ahead with Insights on the Latest in Technology

The IT Trends course focuses on keeping up with the fast-evolving world of technology. 
Students engage in weekly activities that include reading diverse IT sources and summarizing key learnings through blog posts. 
Each week, students write a personal blog post titled “Today I Have Learned,” capturing essential insights from industry trends. 
In addition, students will present their findings and participate in class discussions, fostering a collaborative learning environment. 
This course aims to build research skills, communication proficiency, and awareness of ongoing IT developments.
